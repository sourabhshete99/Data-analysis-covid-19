# Data-analysis-covid-19
Data analysis project on Covid-19 data (as of till Jan 2021)

PROCEDURE :
The covid data required for this analysing  project is downloaded from the sites given below
  https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv 
  https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv
The data is fetched from these sites and a new csv file is created out of it and the same files are then used all over further.

Modules used:
Several python modules are used out of which - Pandas and Matplotlib are majorly used.

NOTE:
  At the end, I was trying to predict some data using regression models and machine learning but got stuck with installing some packages/modules on my machine which are required for machine learning algorithms. 
  If anybody interested in contributing with it, then it'll be appreciated.
  Thank you.
